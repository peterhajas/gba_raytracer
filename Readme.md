A note on building:

This uses the pretty-easy-to-use devkitPro SDK found at http://devkitpro.org

You'll need to run their `perl` script to get everything you need.

You can find that at [this](http://sourceforge.net/p/devkitpro/perlupdaters/ci/e5ba024cbeaac9469762a65d9a71fbce70c2f9b9/tree/devkitARMupdate.pl) page.
